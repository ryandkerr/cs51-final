First things first: download the .zip file and extract its contents. Then, if you have Python installed on your machine, just open up a command prompt and navigate to the newly extracted code directory. Once there, enter “python connectFour.py” to run the interactive game, or “python cpuFour.py” to watch two AIs duke it out. These commands will both compile and run the code, so no need to worry about "make". If you don’t have Python installed on your machine, see the installation guide linked below.
